# CMAP
R codes to classify a remote sensing time-series into land cover trajectories using the Compound Maximum a Posteriori algorithm.

These codes are under revision and being made public accordingly. Preliminary versions of codes and demonstration database may be made available conditioned to direct and reasonable requests.

Please either create an Issue (https://github.com/marianesreis/CMAP/issues) or contact me on mariane.reis@inpe.br for more information.

When using the algorithm, please cite the original paper:
